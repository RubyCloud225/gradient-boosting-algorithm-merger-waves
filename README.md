# gradient-boosting-algorithm-merger-waves

The objective is to predict the occurance of merger wave during the pandemic using volume of trades during the period of march 2020 to march 2021. 

By using a custom algorithm we can see evidence of clustering indiciating the presence of a merger wave. 

the accuracy level is very high.
